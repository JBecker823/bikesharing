Summary of report: 
If you have ever driven in New York City and tried to get anywhere fast it is almost nearly impossible. Bikeshare is a popular way to get from place to place faster than walking or possibly even driving. For the analysis we used a given dataset to determine the length of bike rides, the times, where they are starting and finishing at, and if men, women or other are riding more frequently. We used visualization tools to show different graphs and charts with the final information. We showed the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders. We showed the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week. We also showed the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. 
To display the information clearly there are stories and dashboards with the different visualization tools added.
